## Introduction

My name is Samuele Zanca and I'm a Full-Stack Software Developer.

I'm mostly self-taught, having been introduced to programming by Italy's equivalent to secondary school and soon after my first language/year I was learning languages and technologies on my own. [Read more about me](about_me.md)

## Teaching Philosophy

My goal as a teacher is not teach "coding in java/python/javascript", my goal is to teach how to think like a Software Developer.

I my opinion, a good developer:
 - Is at least aware of the [Unix Philosophy](philosophy/unix_philosophy.md) and tries to apply it whenever possible to improve develper experience.
