# Samuel's Teaching Curriculum

In this Living Document you'll find my personal notes I use for teaching Software development

Breifly, who am I? I'm a full stack software engineer and I'm always striving to be the best version of myself. I think paying the knowledge and teachings forward is something we should all do. Not just becuase we can help others learn but also as a self-improvement tool via the protégé effect. You can read more about me. [here](about.md)

## What you'll learn

My goal as a teacher is not teach "coding in java/python/javascript", my goal is to teach how to think like a Software Developer.

You'll learn: 
- To solve the problem first, then write the code.
- To (*loosely*) follow [The Unix Philosophy](philosophy/unix_philosophy.md) to make the development process easier.
- To be mindful of the industry standards, convetions and best practices.
- To keep it simple. Aka don't overrengineer your code. I fall victim to over-engineering quite often. [[example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AQfQFcXac8)]
