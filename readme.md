# Samuel's Teaching Curriculum

In this Living Document you'll find my personal notes I use for teaching Software development  

. [Read more about me](about.md)




## What you'll learn

My goal as a teacher is not teach "coding in java/python/javascript", my goal is to teach how to think like a Software Developer.

- I'll teach you to solve the problem first, then write the code.
- I'll teach you to (*loosely*) follow [The Unix Philosophy](philosophy/unix_philosophy.md) to make the development process easier.
- I'll teach you to be mindful of the industry standards, convetions and best practices.
- Keep it simple stupid. Aka don't overrengineer your code. I fall victim to over-engineering quite often. [[example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AQfQFcXac8)]
