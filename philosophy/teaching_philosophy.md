# Teaching Philosophy

## Avoiding common mistakes

The most common mistake many teachers/professors make is to think that the code newbies are already computer scientists and intro them with a 1 hour long lecture on any given subject. The reason they do this, is they've forgotten what its like to be a beginner. They're now speaking from a position of knowledge and they are completely unaware of what working knowledge the average Joe will have.

To the un-initiated, after 5 minutes of lecturing on complex topics they've never heard of can be exausting. After 5 minutes they're already either day-dreaming or on their phones.

A friend struggling in college gave me a 63 page PDF of slides his professor showed the class on their "intro to programming" in java course. The contents ranged from history of programming and why java was created, to how the language worked from an architectural stand point.

All very interesting information, but completely useless in a course entitled "Intro to programming". ([This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPUjtzS_zwY) is a scene from the Big Bang Theory in which this exact thing happens. We probably shouldn't take teaching advice from Sheldon Cooper.)

## Unnecessarily overcomplicating things
> "Death By Theory"

At its core, coding is really really simple. It has to be; otherwise it wouldn't work. Computers are very stupid, you have to tell them exactly what to do. And the goal of programming isn't coding,but problem solving.

When teaching code, you need to be aware that most people learn by doing and so you should jump right in with some simple examples and exercises to make them immediatly start problem solving. If you keep them ingaged like this, they're less likely to start wandering off.

Just like Software Development is an iterative process, teaching it should also be iterative. Start with the fundamentals, do write some code, explain some flow control, write some code, explain something else, write even more code.

Programming is complex, but not because the concepts are fundamentally difficult but because they're comprised by a lot of simple things, which at scale become hard to keep track of when just starting out.
