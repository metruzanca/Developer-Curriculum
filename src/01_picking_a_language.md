# Picking a language

First things first. There is no perfect language that does everything and is better than other languages. Each one has their own set of pros and cons as well as effective use cases.

If you're new to programming, you should pick your first language based on what you'd like to be able to do e.g. Do you want to make video games? C# is a good choice to start with.

Learning to program is easier if you're working towards a specific goal. However, if don't have a specific goal in mind. There are languages that are easier for beginners.

My personal choice for a starter language for general purpose programming, is Python. The reasons behind this choice is Python is easy to install, has an easy syntax and is a multi-paradim general purpose language.

If you're a college/school student and you're struggling with your course material, you should of course continue with the language that was picked for you. Changing teachers is sometimes enough to start understanding things. Especially if doing a 1 on 1 kind of session.

> multi-paradigm: Meaning it supports multiple coding styles.

> general purpose: Meaning it can be used for a wide veriety of use cases.

The following are a list of languages, with their pros and cons, a list of things you can expect to be able to achieve with it along with some other information relating to this course.
