# Setting up your coding enviroment

I'm of the opinion that the best and easiest way to develop software is via the use of Unix-like operating systems. Luckily, in this day in age even windows supports this kind of development style.

This is the way I setup all my machines when developing software, regardless of what language I'm using. Of course each will have their own tooling, but the underlying system is always the same.

## Windows

If you're running windows, and have used a mac in the past, you're probably aware that the two have many differences that even the average user might have noticed. This is because windows is not a Unix-like operating system. ([More on this topic](unix_vs_dos.md)) Luckily, in 2016 windows decided to integrate a linux virtual machine into windows and called WSL. This allows us to run linux applications on our windows machine in a seamless maner.

### Installing WSL

TODO Installing wsl tutorial

## Mac

TODO installing brew and other mac tools

## Linux

If you're running linux, I'm pretty sure you can just skip to [Picking a language](#Picking-a-language) as you likely already know what you're doing but also because you're already set. Just make sure you've got your terminal on hand.
