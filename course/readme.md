# Setting up your coding enviroment

I'm of the opinion that the best and easiest way to develop software is via the use of Unix-like operating systems. Luckily, in this day in age even windows supports this kind of development style.

This is the way I setup all my machines when developing software, regardless of what language I'm using. Of course each will have their own tooling, but the underlying system is always the same. 

## Windows
If you're running windows, and have used a mac in the past, you're probably aware that the two have many differences that even the average user might have noticed. This is because windows is not a Unix-like operating system. ([More on this topic](unix_vs_dos.md)) Luckily, in 2016 windows decided to integrate a linux virtual machine into windows and called WSL. This allows us to run linux applications on our windows machine in a seamless maner.

### Installing WSL

TODO Installing wsl tutorial

## Mac

TODO installing brew and other mac tools

## Linux
If you're running linux, I'm pretty sure you can just skip to [Picking a language](#Picking-a-language) as you likely already know what you're doing but also because you're already set. Just make sure you've got your terminal on hand.

# Picking a language

First things first. There is no perfect language that does everything and is better than other languages. Each one has their own set of pros and cons as well as effective use cases.

If you're new to programming, you should pick your first language based on what you'd like to be able to do e.g. Do you want to make video games? C# is a good choice to start with.

Learning to program is easier if you're working towards a specific goal. However, if don't have a specific goal in mind. There are languages that are easier for beginners.

My personal choice for a starter language for general purpose programming, is Python. The reasons behind this choice is Python is easy to install, has an easy syntax and is a multi-paradim general purpose language.

If you're a college/school student and you're struggling with your course material, you should of course continue with the language that was picked for you. Changing teachers is sometimes enough to start understanding things. Especially if doing a 1 on 1 kind of session.

> multi-paradigm: Meaning it supports multiple coding styles.

> general purpose: Meaning it can be used for a wide veriety of use cases.

The following are a list of languages, with their pros and cons, a list of things you can expect to be able to achieve with it along with some other information relating to this course.
